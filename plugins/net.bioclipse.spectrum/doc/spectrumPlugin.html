<h1>The Spectrum plug-in</h1>
<p>
The Bioclipse spectrum plug-in provides various graphical and non graphical tools and
methods for spectrum visualisation, analysis and manipulation. It is mainly formed by an 
editor containing four different tabs (metadata table, peak table, two charts showing the spectrums 
peak and continuous data and a source code tab) and the regarding methods/actions.</p>
<p>For scripting this plugin, see the <a href="/help/topic/net.bioclipse.doc/html/scriptingBioclipse.html">general scripting guide</a> and the <a href="/help/topic/net.bioclipse.doc.speclipse/html/index.html">Speclipse scripting functionality help</a>.</p>
<p>The following graphical functionality is available:
<ul><li>Menus: You can calculate the similarity of spectra. Select a number of 
spectrum files (showing the <img src="../icons/spectrum.gif">logo), right click 
and choose "Calculate Spectrum similarity". If 
you select two spectra and choose this option, you get a similarity value 
displayed. If you choose one or more than two, you get a wizard where you need 
to choose the spectrum to which similarity is to be calculated. The values are 
then displayed.</li>
<li>Views: A view is available for graphically comparing peak spectra. The view can be shown via "Window -> Views -> Spectrum -> Compare Spectra". 
All files chosen in the navigator will then be displayed there given they contain peaks. The scaling of
all spectra is uniform in able to make a comparision possible. Shifts found in all spectra (at the same or 
almost same position) are highlighted.</li>
<li>Editors: A <a href="spectrumEditor.html">spectrum editor</a> is available.</li>
<li>Wizards: A <a href="new.html">new spectrum wizard</a> is available.</li>
</ul>
<p>The plug-in includes the possibility of importing and exporting spectrum files in <a href="formats.html">the supported formats</a> to the Bioclipse platform, whereas internally all spectrum data is stored and passed around as
CML Java objects. If a spectrum contains only continuous, a peak picking action is available extracting 
the peaks from that data.
