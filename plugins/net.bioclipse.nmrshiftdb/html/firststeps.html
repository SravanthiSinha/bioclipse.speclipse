<h1>Getting started with Speclipse</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Speclipse is an extension for Bioclipse to work with 
spectral data. Since you read this, you have installed it 
properly. Here, we show you what you can now do</p>
<h2>Install sample data</h2>
<p>You should install the sample data. This can be done by choosing File->New
->Data->Speclipse Sample Data Project from the menu. Leave the defaults and 
choose Next and Finish. The new Project will contain two subfolders, which 
represent the two data types Speclipse handles: spectra and assigned peak 
spectra.</p>
<h2>Work with spectra</h2>
<img src="images/speceditor.png">
<p>This screenshot shows several elements of what you can do with spectra:
<ul>
<li>Continuous spectrum and peak visible, peaks can be picked and the integral 
shown</li>
<li>Metadata are visible in the outline and can be edited on other tabs</li>
<li>You can save in different <a href="/help/topic/net.bioclipse.spectrum/doc/formats.html">formats</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Go to Help->Cheat Sheets->Spectra->General Spectrum Cheat Sheet to get more 
details on this</p>
<h2>Assigend Spectra</h2>
</body>

<p>In Speclipse, you can combine a structure and one or more spectrum in one 
CML file and assign the peaks. The screenshot shows a file opened in the 
editor and some hints on what you can do. See the <a href=
"/help/topic/net.bioclipse.specmol/html/maintopic.html">Assigned Spectrum help</a> for 
details.</p>
<h2>Scripting</h2>
<p>The functionalities of the plugins are also available via the Bioclipse 
scripting language. See the <a href="/help/topic/net.bioclipse.doc/html/scriptingBioclipse.html">general scripting help</a> 
and the <a href="/help/topic/net.bioclipse.doc.speclipse/html/index.html">Speclipse 
scripting help</a> for details. The following script is an example, which 
loads a continuous spectrum and picks its peaks and saves the result as 
a CML file:<p>
<pre>contspectrum = spectrum.loadSpectrum("/Sample Data1/Speclipse/spectra/aug07.dx")
peaks = spectrum.pickPeaks(contspectrum)
spectrum.saveSpectrum(peaks, "/Sample Data 1/test.cml", "cml")</pre>
