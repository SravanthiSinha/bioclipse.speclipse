<h1>Submitting Data to NMRShiftDB</h1>
<p>Via this function you can submit data from bioclipse to NMRShiftDB. The data must be available as an Assigned Spectrum file. For an explanation, 
how to create one, see the <a href="/help/topic/net.bioclipse.specmol/html/creating.html">help for the Assigned Spectrum plugin</a>. The idea behind this is that the SpecMol resource enables you to reuse existing data as much as possible. 
E. g. you can use a JCAMP-DX file you already have and a mol file you drew for you latest paper. In this way, an NMRShiftDB submission is a logical step without much work 
for your exising data. Obviously, you can also create a SpecMol resource from scratch. A resource you want to submit must have one structure and at least one spectrum of 
type NMR. For doing a submit, right click on the SpecMol resource in the BioResource navigator and choose "Submit to NMRShiftDB".</p>
<p>You get a window showing several panes, one for the molecule and one for each spectrum. Here you can enter additional information about 
the molecule and each spectum. Some of the fields may already show content, which you entered in the Spectrum or the Structure editor. If you fill in data here, 
they will be saved in the SpecMolResource after the submit. Each spectrum tab also contains a checkbox, which excludes this spectrum from the submit if unchecked.</p>
<p>When ready, press "Next". This gives you a page where you need to enter your NMRShiftDB username and password (if you do not
yet have one, go to <a href="http://www.nmrshiftdb.org">http://www.nmrshiftdb.org/</a> for registration) and choose an NMRShiftDB server (the default should be fine). You can then press "Finish" and your submission should go to the server. If you want 
to have a literature reference for a spectrum, you need have it in a BibTex file (you can use the BibTex pluging to create one). When you have a spectrum open in the SpecMol editor, you can add an entry to it (see BibTex plugin help).</a>
<p>If your submit was succesfully handled, you will get a message saying this. The submit will go to the normal NMRShiftDB review process (for details, see the online help at 
<a href="http://www.nmrshiftdb.org">http://www.nmrshiftdb.org/</a>). If you get an error message, you should first try to resolve the problem (e. g. when you mistyped the password). If you cannot solve it, send the smr file to 
the administrator email mentioned at <a href="http://www.nmrshiftdb.org">http://www.nmrshiftdb.org/</a>. They will take care of it. In no case your data are lost when the submit fails.</p>
<p>Once you did the submit, there exist two copies of the data: Locally in Bioclipse and in the NMRShiftdb system. Obviously, these are not synchronized, meaning that if the data change on the server (an edit is done), 
they do not change locally. When you changed data locally, you can do a submit again. If the data (meaning the particular spectrum in the smr file) have already been submitted before, 
this is considered an edit, i. e. no new entry in NMRShiftDB is done, but your new data get merged into the existing entry.</p>
<p>Right clicking on an smr file gives you the "Clone this submit to a new submit ..." option. This will copy the smr file to a new smr file with the same content, but without the association to an 
NMRShiftDB entry, meaning submitting the new file will not be an edit (as with the old file), but a new submit. You can use this to submit two similar entries by submitting the first entry, cloning it, changing the clone 
(which will be easier than making a new entry) and submitting the clone.</p>
