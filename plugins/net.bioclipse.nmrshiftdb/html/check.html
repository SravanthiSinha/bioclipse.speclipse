<h1>Check spectrum</h1>
<p>If you have a SpecMol resource open in the Assigned Spectrum editor, you can check if the spectrum 
is plausible via an NMRShiftDB prediction. After you have executed the menu "NMRSHiftDB"->"Assign by Prediction", the 
spectrum table in the Assigned Spectrum editor has an additional column. This column gives a number of values for 
each shift derived from a prediction in NMRShiftDB: A minimum value, the mean value ("the prediction") and a maximum 
value. In brackets, the median, the number of values used for the prediction and the number of spheres used in the 
HOSE code are given. If a value in your spectrum is outside of the range given by minimum and maximum value, the 
row is coloured in red.</p>
