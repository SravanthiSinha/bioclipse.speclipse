<h1>About BibTex plugin</h1>
<p>The BibTex plugin integrates BibTex files into Bioclipse. These can be used to store literature references for various purposes. The following functions are offered by the plugin:
<ul><li>You can create a new BibTex file via "File" -> "New" -> "BibTex" -> "New Bibtex file". You can choose to have the file empty or to have template entries in it for an article, book and URL.</li>
<li>You can open a BibTex file either in a text editor (by double clicking) or you can open it in the open source BibTex editor Jabref (by right clicking on the resource).</li>
</ul></p>
